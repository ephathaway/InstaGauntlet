# InstaGauntlet
A tool specifically designed to optimize team assignments for the time-honored tradition of University of Oregon a cappella.

This software uses an iterative strategy to test out different team arrangements and find the one with the least variability in rankings between the teams. It includes a GUI for entering information for each player.

Optimize.py is where the Player and Team classes are defined. It also includes all the necessary functions for testing the variability in scores between teams.

GUI.py controls the user interface.

Main.py sets up the main window for the user interface and launches it.
